## Scoring Breakdown

The priority score is now displayed with a breakdown of its components:

**Format:** `Priority Score: X.X (A.A Age, B.B Engagement[, C.C Context analysis])`

Where:
- **Age**: Points based on issue age (older issues get more points, max 50)
  - Calculation: `min(age_days / 2, 50)`
- **Engagement**: Points from community engagement (comments)
  - Calculation: `min(comments * 3, 50)`
- **Context analysis** (optional): AI-determined priority based on keyword context (0-50 points)
  - Only shown if contextual analysis is enabled

### Example

Issue #42 with:
- Age: 45 days â†’ 22.5 points (45/2)
- Comments: 12 â†’ 36.0 points (12*3, capped at 50)
